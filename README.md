# Simple Linear Regression Model in Python

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Simple Linear Regression model using Python. It is part of an assignment for the Cyber Shujaa Program (Data and Artificial Intelligence track).

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to predict salaries based on years of experience using a linear regression model. The dataset consists of two variables:
- `YearsExperience`: Number of years of professional experience
- `Salary`: Annual salary in USD

This exercise helps in understanding the core principles of supervised learning, model training, and evaluation using the `scikit-learn` library.

## Objectives

- Load and explore a structured dataset using Pandas
- Visualize relationships between features using Matplotlib
- Train and test a Simple Linear Regression model
- Evaluate model performance using RÂ² score and regression metrics
- Visualize predictions and regression line

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## File Structure

- `SIMPLR LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL (1).ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all code, outputs, and visualizations
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation
